## Development Patterns

### Component Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Props interfaces should be prefixed with 'I'
- Export components as named exports
- Place components in feature-based folders

### State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use Zustand for global client state
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### File Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Shared components in /components
- Business logic in /hooks and /utils
